We know that technology is developing in this rapidly changing world and it is developing the Ô¨Åeld of robotics. The world of robotics is growing exponentially and nowadays robots are used in many eld such as medicine, industries, entertainment, household, defense, etc. A robot can do what a man can or cannot do with high accuracy and in better ways. Our project aims at the use of robots in the eld of defense. In the proposed design, a robotic system is developed with real-time object detection along with movement and ring mechanism. The robot can be moved in the front, back, right and left direction depending upon the will of the operator. Also, the real-time human body detection system is used in this robot. The real-time human detection is important in various eld like computer vision, communication system, security purposes and many more. A surveillance system is basically built using many cameras that are located at different positions in order to track human or human activities. But a surveillance system with many cameras is very complicated

and thus hard to design. So in the proposed system, only one camera is mounted on the robot to avoid complications. The robot is in the form of a tank with a circular base on which a rotating platform is mounted which enables 360 vision for the robot. This is achieved using a stepper motor. On this rotating platform, a gun is mounted which is capable of moving up and down depending upon the location of the target and this is achieved using another stepper motor. A camera is mounted on the same axis on which the gun is mounted so that the gun and the camera are in the same horizon. The motion of the robot is controlled using Accelerometers. The motion of the robot could be controlled using two methods: -hardwired control and wireless control. We chose to go with the wireless control because of its advantages over hardwired controls which include high exibility for the robot for its motion, low installation cost and easy installation.
